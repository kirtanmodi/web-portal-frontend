# Frontend Repository

This repository contains the frontend code for the web portal built using React and Material-UI (MUI5). It communicates with the backend server to perform CRUD operations on a CSV-formatted file.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kirtanmodi/web-portal-frontend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend application will be served on a development server and can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

The frontend application provides a user interface to interact with the backend APIs and perform CRUD operations on the data.

## Development

To build the frontend application for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized and minified production-ready files will be generated in the `build` directory.
